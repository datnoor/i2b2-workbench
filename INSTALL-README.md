# i2b2 Workbench Installation

The [i2b2 Installation Guide](http://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/getstarted/i2b2+Installation+Guide) contains detailed information about setting up the i2b2 in your environment. The installation of the i2b2 Workbench is addressed in [Chapter 8. i2b2 Workbench Install](http://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/getstarted/Chapter+8.+i2b2+Workbench+Install)

<br />
**_IMPORTANT:_**

The _i2b2-Workbench repository_ contains the source code for the i2b2 Workbench Client. If you are downloading the source code from this repository and want to run the Workbench then you will need to add the **edu.harvard.i2b2.xml** directory into your local i2b2 Workbench directory. The Workbench needs this information in order to send messages to the i2b2 Server.

The _edu.harvard.i2b2.xml_ directory can be found in the [i2b2-core-server](https://github.com/i2b2/i2b2-core-server) repository.
